			    <p>Employers use application forms as a selection tool, so it\'s essential that you demonstrate your skills and experience effectively.</p>
			    <br>
				<div class="divider"></div>
				<br>
				<p>Employers use application forms as evidence that:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>- you can do the job (<strong>ability and skills</strong>)</li>
					<li>- you want the job (<strong>motivation</strong>)</li>
					<li>- you want to work for them and will fit into their organisation (<strong>values</strong>)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Employers also use application forms as a <strong>de-selection</strong> tool. Badly presented forms or forms with incomplete or inadequate answers may be immediately rejected.</p>
				<p>Remember, an application form is your \'personal marketing brochure\' – you are trying to persuade the selector that they should interview you.</p>
				<p>Application form questions require you to be <strong>self-aware and to think about your skills</strong> and how you have developed these from your study, work experience, interests and activities.</p>

				<p>Find out as much as you can about the position and research the organisation you are applying to. You will also need to <strong>analyse yourself</strong>.</p>
				<p><strong>Prepare a list of what the job requires</strong> and ask yourself if you possess the necessary skills. Think of <strong>examples of when you have demonstrated these skills</strong>, for example:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>- in a vacation or part-time job</li>
					<li>- when undertaking a voluntary activity</li>
					<li>- within your academic course</li>
					<li>- Demonstrating skills</li>

		    	<br>
				<div class="divider"></div>
				<br>
				<p>We\'ve listed below some <strong>typical application form questions</strong> that are used to test whether:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>- you can do the job</li>
					<li>- you want the job</li>
					<li>- you want to work for the organisation</li>
				</ul>

				<br>
				<div class="divider"></div>
				<br>

				<h4>Testing your ability to do the job</h4>
				<p>Describe a challenging project, activity or event which you have planned and taken through to a conclusion. Include your objective, what you did, any changes you made to your plan and state how you measured your success.</p>
				<p>Describe how you achieved a goal through influencing the actions or opinions of others. What were the circumstances? What did you do to make a difference? How do you know the result was satisfactory?</p>
				<p>Describe a difficult problem that you have solved. State how you decided which were the critical issues, say what you did and what your solution was. What other approaches could you have used?</p>

				<br>
				<div class="divider"></div>
				<br>

				<h4>Testing that you want the job</h4>
				<p>Explain why you have applied for this particular job. Provide evidence of your suitability.</p>
				<p>Why do you consider yourself to be a strong candidate for this position?</p>
				<p>Please tell us what steps you have taken in deciding your proposed career choice.</p>

				<br>
				<div class="divider"></div>
				<br>

				<h4>Testing that you want to work for the organisation</h4>
				<p>Please describe your reasons for applying to this organisation.</p>
				<p>Tell us why you have applied to this organisation rather than some of our major competitors.</p>

		    	<p>The different types of questions on application forms test that you have the ability and interest to do a job. Here we\'ve listed ways you can demonstrate this and how to structure your answer.</p>

		    	<br>
				<div class="divider"></div>
				<br>

				<h4>Demonstrating your ability, skills, interest and motivation</h4>
				<p>You can demonstrate your ability to do a job and your interest in the role through:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>- academic studies, eg relevant modules, project work, dissertation</li>
					<li>- work experience, eg vacation, voluntary, part-time, placement</li>
					<li>- involvement in student societies</li>
					<li>- interests and activities</li>
					<li>- areas of responsibility</li>
				</ul>

				<br>
				<div class="divider"></div>
				<br>

				<h4>Demonstrating your interest in the employer</h4>
				<p>Find out about the employer by visiting their website, but don\'t just copy extracts from the site onto your form.</p>
				<p>You can also demonstrate interest in an employer through:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>- employer presentations you\'ve attended</li>
					<li>- contacts you have made, eg through LinkedIn</li>
				</ul>
				<p>You can find further information and advice at the Careers Service.</p>

				<br>
				<div class="divider"></div>
				<br>

				<h4>Structuring your answer</h4>
				<p>When structuring your answer, use the \'STAR\' approach to outline situation, task, actions and result.</p>

				<p class="teal-text">Situation</p>
				<p>Describe the situation: briefly provide context to help the employer understand the example you\'re giving. You don\'t need to go into a lot of detail at this stage.</p>

				<p class="teal-text">Task</p>
				<p>Explain the task: provide a concise overview, ensuring that your example is relevant to the question.</p>

				<p class="teal-text">Actions</p>
				<p>Describe and analyse your actions. This part should form the bulk of your answer. State what action you took, focusing on your contribution. Explain what, how and why you did it - be reflective, rather than just descriptive. Avoid ‘we’ if talking about a situation in a team.</p>

				<p class="teal-text">Result</p>
				<p>Explain the result - what was the outcome? What did you learn from this example?</p>

				<p>Remember, it\'s not just what you did, but how you did it that is important.</p>

				<p>See Guardian Careers: How to answer competency-based questions on job application forms and the Open University article STAR technique for more advice on using this approach successfully.</p>

				<h4>Ten key points to remember</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Read guidelines carefully before you start, eg can you save an online form and come back to it?</li>
					<li>Complete every section and closely match the stated criteria</li>
					<li>Make sure you actually answer the question, especially if it is in several parts</li>
					<li>Use a range of examples in your answers</li>
					<li>Make sure your answers are succinct; avoid lengthy descriptions</li>
					<li>Check your spelling and grammar carefully</li>
					<li>Always write in the positive and never make excuses for not having skills or experience</li>
					<li>Don\'t include your CV (unless asked for) or cut and paste extracts from your CV</li>
					<li>Keep a copy of your form for future reference</li>
				</ol>
